Rate Monotonic
--------------
- How to order a periodic tasks?
Smallest one? Arrived First (suggested)?

- Ensuring a task finished before period?
Tardiness = metric we have to display at the end.
=> Soft real-time.


Periodicity
-----------
- For all algorithms
- Tasks come back N times and then don't come back (no hyperperiod)


RMS
___
- If not schedulable according to schedulability test => we do our best anyway
and compute tardiness/deadline misses


EDF
---
- Schedulability: V = sum_{i=0}^{nb_tasks}(units_i/period_i) < 1 ?


Schedulability
--------------
- Schedulability = no deadline misses, no tardiness
